A science fair project where I learned how neural networks work.

Ever wondered how AI and Neural Networks work? This repository has tons of interactive examples of neural networks, including:
- Real-time visualization of Neural Networks
  - Teaching the neural network yourself by slidng the weights and biases
  - Learn Button
  - Graph of the predictions
  - Loss display
