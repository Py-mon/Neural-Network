2024 Science Fair Project Winner

A science fair project where I learned how neural networks work.

Ever wondered how AI and Neural Networks work? This repository has tons of interactive examples of neural networks, including:
- Real-time visualization of Neural Networks and their predictions
- Teaching the neural network yourself by slidng the weights and biases
- Draw hand-drawn digits and see the network guess

- Graphs of different activation functions
